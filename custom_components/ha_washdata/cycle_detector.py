# a flat standby when every reading of the last max(off_delay,
# STANDBY_BAND_WINDOW_S) seconds is above 0 W and the window spans no more than
# max(FLOOR_W, FRAC x its highest reading). The non-zero floor is what keeps the

      is on, and it returns a TRIPLE.

      used to get nothing at all, because element 10 was supplied only when

    present in only one of them is invisible to every measurement made with that

        ``_p95_dt`` is the 2nd-largest of the last 20 intervals by construction,
        so it tracks the worst *gap* rather than the reporting rate. That is the
        right input for the outage ceilings (a gap must be judged against the
        worst gap we consider normal) but the wrong one for the gates below,
        which multiply it by three: once a publish-on-change plug falls silent at
        standby, the only intervals left are the long quiet ones, p95 collapses
        onto them, and each gate becomes ~3x the silence it is supposed to be
        measuring. The accumulator advances one interval per reading, so the
        cycle then needs ~3 more readings - a gate that is set by, and grows
        with, its own input. Measured on the #427 trace: a 297 s sensor silence
        followed by a 481 s keepalive lifted the end gate from 45 s to 1455 s and
        held the cycle in PAUSED for 25.5 min.

        Capping p95 at a multiple of the *median* keeps the estimate robust: a
        genuinely slow sensor reports slowly every time, so its median equals its
        p95 and the cap never binds (a 300 s-cadence meter keeps its 900 s gate);
        a fast sensor that went quiet has a small median, so the isolated holes
        cannot triple the gate. Only these two gates read it - ``_p95_dt`` itself
        is left alone so every outage ceiling keeps the cadence snapshot it was
        tuned against (register items 213, 215).

        The cap alone was not enough, and the reason is worth keeping: it is
        computed over the same 20-interval window it is meant to protect. Once a
        publish-on-change plug falls silent the watchdog's own 0 W keepalives are
        the only readings left, so the median collapses onto the injection spacing
        too and ``5 x median`` stops binding - the gate then grows with our
        injection rate instead of the plug's. Fixed at the source (register item
        289): ``process_reading`` no longer trains the cadence on synthetic
        readings, so this window describes the sensor and nothing else.

        ``synthetic=True`` marks a reading the *manager* injected rather than one
        the power sensor sent: the watchdog and anti-wrinkle keepalives, which
        exist to advance the quiet timers while a change-only plug says nothing.
        They must keep doing exactly that, so this flag does not change the quiet
        accumulators. What it does change is the two places that reason about what
        the SENSOR did (#424):

        * ``_update_cadence`` is skipped. The cadence estimate feeds
          ``_gate_cadence`` and therefore the pause/end gates, so training it on
          our own injections makes those gates a function of how often we inject -
          see the note on ``_gate_cadence``.
        * **with ``observed=True``**, the gap-free tally treats the interval as
          observed, because the watchdog re-anchored on the sensor's live state
          (``_resync_power_from_state``) before injecting - so the keepalive is a
          moment we looked rather than a hole in the record.

        ``observed=False`` says the sensor state could NOT be read when this
        keepalive was injected (unavailable / unknown / non-finite). The second
        bullet is then false: the interval it closes is a genuine outage, and the
        gap-free tally is reset like any other hole - at ANY step size, since the
        watchdog injects far more often than the outage ceiling.

        A RECORDED outage (``mark_sensor_unavailable``, register item 266) goes
        further, because only it says where the hole began: from its start until
        the next real reading, time is not added to ``_time_below_threshold``
        either, so an outage can no longer run out an end gate. A keepalive inside
        one advances the clock and nothing else - no state-machine step, no
        sample in the trace - so no decision rests on a value nobody read. The
        manager's staleness force-stop still ends a cycle whose sensor stays dead.
        ``observed=False`` alone (a late watchdog tick, item 391) keeps its
        narrower meaning: it resets the gap-free tally only.

        (The `_keep_tail_cap` use this flag was originally added for, register
        item 238, was implemented, measured and reverted: after
        ``_last_active_time`` every reading is below the stop threshold anyway, so
        a plug still reporting cannot separate a drying phase from standby - it
        only shows the plug is chatty. See item 260 for two more that were
        measured and rejected.)

        * When ``offset_s`` falls inside an interval, only the part after the offset

        The paths that keep their tail do so because the tail can be real cycle
        time: a dishwasher's near-0 W passive drying phase sits between the last
        drain spike and the actual end of the programme (issue #43), so snapping
        back to ``_last_active_time`` would store a falsely short cycle. But they
        fire on accumulated quiet time, and on a publish-on-change plug that wait
        is minutes of *post-appliance* standby - which stamping ``timestamp`` as
        the end time banked as cycle time.

        Measured on the #424 reporter's dishwasher: every cycle that ended via
        `timeout` stored a 0-29 s tail (237-239 min, matching the appliance), and
        every cycle that ended via `smart` stored a 96-1239 s tail (240-260 min),
        with ``_last_active_time`` unchanged across the whole history - only the
        termination path differed. It also self-amplifies, because the inflated
        duration feeds ``avg_duration``, which raises ``expected_duration``,
        which delays the next Smart Termination further (the second reporter's
        profile had already drifted 63 -> 70.5 min).

        The cap used to be the matched profile's **expected end**. That is the
        mean of these same stored durations, so it moved with the thing it was
        bounding: a banked tail raised ``avg_duration``, the higher average
        allowed a longer tail, and the reported end drifted later every run.
        Measured over 375 cycles from 16 devices, smart-terminated cycles banked a
        median **12.6 min** of post-appliance time (washing machines **22.7 min**,
        p90 40.4 min) against ~0 min for every other termination path, and the
        profiles carried a mean **+5.3%** duration inflation as a result - on the
        #427 reporter's washer, +20.2 min on a 108 min programme, which is also
        why their ETA read 131 min for a ~105 min wash.

        So anchor on the last real activity instead. Where a passive phase can
        legitimately follow it, allow only what this programme has been
        **measured** to do (``profile_terminal_quiet_seconds``, element 11) - a
        statistic taken from the traces, not from the stored durations, so it
        cannot be inflated by the tail it bounds, and gated on having been seen
        repeatedly rather than once.

        **Only a dishwasher has a passive terminal phase.** Every other type ends
        on activity - a washer's spin, a dryer's drum - which ``_last_active_time``
        already marks, so there is nothing legitimate to bank after it. That is
        not a new assumption: the fallback-timeout path beside this one has always
        read ``keep_tail = device_type == "dishwasher"``. Smart Termination was
        the one path that kept a tail for every type, which is exactly where the
        22.7 min washing-machine median came from.

        Within the dishwasher case, two sub-cases, and the difference matters:

        * the run produced its terminal pump-out (``_end_spike_seen``).
          ``_last_active_time`` already sits on it, so that IS the end.
        * it did not, so the programme ended in its passive drying phase. Allow up
          to the profile's measured quiet span past the last activity.

        Falls back to the old expected-end cap when that span has not been
        measured, rather than truncating a drying phase on no evidence - the
        measured corpus shows the pump-out missing in a substantial minority of
        runs on some machines, and in those runs the drying IS the tail. Still
        asymmetric and shorten-only; still None for an unmatched cycle.
