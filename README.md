# WashData Integration

A Home Assistant custom component to monitor washing machines via smart sockets, learn power profiles, and estimate completion time using shape-correlation matching.

> [!CAUTION]  
> **ELECTRICAL SAFETY WARNING**: Using smart plugs such as Shelly or Sonoff with high-amperage appliances (washing machines, dryers, dishwashers) carries significant risk.  
> 
> *   **Fire Hazard**: Cheap or low-rated smart plugs may overheat, melt, or catch fire under sustained high loads (heating/drying phases).  
> *   **Rating Check**: Ensure your smart plug is rated for the **maximum peak power** of your appliance (often >2500W). Standard 10A plugs may fail; 16A+ or hardwired modules are recommended.  
> *   **Use at Your Own Risk**: The authors of this integration are not responsible for any electrical damage or fires caused by improper hardware usage. inspect your hardware regularly.

## ✨ Features

- **Multi-Device Support**: Track Washing Machines, Dryers, Washer-Dryer Combos, Dishwashers, Coffee Machines, Electric Vehicles (EV), Air Fryers, Heat Pumps, Bread Makers, and Pumps/Sump Pumps — each with device-specific defaults and phases.
- **Smart Cycle Detection**: Automatically detects starts/stops with **Predictive End** logic. Includes **End Spike Protection** for dishwashers to capture final pump-outs.
- **Power Spike Filtering**: Ignores brief boot spikes to prevent false starts.
- **Shape-Correlation Matching**: Uses `numpy.corrcoef` with **Confidence Boosting** to distinguish similar cycles.
- **Manual Training**: You define your profiles (e.g., "Cotton", "Quick") once; the system learns to recognize them thereafter. Integration **does not** auto-create profiles.
- **Smart Time Estimation**: "Phase-aware" prediction detects variance (e.g., heating) and locks the countdown to prevent erratic jumps.
- **Changeable Power Sensor**: Switch plugs without losing history.
- **Tile Card** (Minimal Status Card): Optional custom Lovelace card.
- **Manual Program Override**: Select the correct program manually if detection is uncertain; the system learns from your input.
- **Manual Profile Creation**: Create profiles even without historical cycles by specifying a baseline duration (e.g., "Eco Mode - 3h").
- **Unified Phase Catalog**: Manage phase vocabulary across all supported device types from one catalog view.
- **Scoped Phase Assignment**: Phase assignment dialogs show only phases relevant to the configured device type.
- **Ghost Cycle Suppression**: Intelligent filtering with **"Suspicious Window"** (20 mins) prevents end-spikes from triggering duplicate cycles. **Now Persistent**: Remembers cycle history across HA restarts to prevent ghost detections after reboots.
- **Robust vNext State Machine**: Advanced filtering with `start_energy` and `end_energy` gates prevents false starts/ends.
- **Multi-Stage Matching Pipeline**: Uses Fast Reject -> Core Similarity -> DTW-Lite tie-breaking for superior accuracy.
- **Local Only**: No cloud dependency, no external services. All data stays in your Home Assistant.
- **Notifications**: Integrated alerts for cycle start, finish, and **pre-completion** (e.g., 5 mins before finish).
- **Self-Learning**: Gradually adjusts expected durations based on your confirmed historical data.
- **Realistic Variance**: Handles natural cycle duration variations with configurable tolerance.
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear cycle progress indicator with automatic reset after unload.
- **Auto-Maintenance**: Nightly cleanup - removes broken profiles, merges fragmented cycles (**Empty/New profiles are safely preserved**).
- **Export/Import**: Full configuration backup/restore with all settings and profiles via JSON. Import also accepts HA diagnostics download files directly.
- **User-Triggered Pause/Resume**: Pause and resume active cycles via button entities or HA services. Elapsed time and time-remaining estimates automatically exclude the paused duration. Optional **Cut Power When Pausing** toggle for appliances that maintain their position after a power cut.
- **Door Sensor & Clean State**: Optional binary sensor integration that sets verified pause when the door opens mid-cycle (add-clothes support), and tracks a **Clean** state after cycle end until the door is opened to remind you laundry is waiting.

## ⚡ Getting Started (The "Happy Path")

Follow these steps to get accurate results quickly.

### 1. Initial Setup
1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services** > **Add Integration** > **WashData**.
2. **Name**: Name your appliance (e.g., "Washing Machine").
3. **Device Type**: Select the type (Washer, Dryer, etc.) - this sets smart defaults for the internal logic.
4. **Power Sensor**: Select your smart plug's power entity (Watts). *Note: The system is now optimized for polling intervals of 30-60 seconds (defaults adjusted automatically).*
5. **Initial Profile (Optional)**: If you know your standard program (e.g. "Cotton"), create it now.

#### 💡 Tips for Zigbee2MQTT (Z2M) users
If you are using Zigbee2MQTT with smart plugs, ensure your device reporting is responsive enough for accurate matching:
- **Reporting Intervals**: Decrease the reporting intervals in Z2M (e.g., Min: 1s-10s, Max: 1200s).
- **Power Threshold**: Decrease the minimum updating threshold (e.g., from 5W to 1W or 2W) to ensure small power changes are captured promptly.
- *Note*: These changes may slightly increase Zigbee network traffic.

### 2. The Golden Rule: "Teach" the Integration
WashData **does not** come with pre-built profiles because every machine model is different. You must teach it what your cycles look like.
#### Option A: Manual "Record Mode" (Recommended)
This gives you the cleanest data.

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > WashData > Configure**.
2. Open **Record Cycle (Manual)**, then start your machine.
3. When finished, go to **Manage Cycles** and find the recording.
4. Then open **Manage Profiles** and create a profile from that recording.

#### Option B: The Natural Way
If you prefer to just use it and label later:
1. **Run a Cycle**: Use your machine as normal. WashData will track it as an "Unknown" cycle.
2. **Label It**: After the cycle finishes:
   - Go to **Manage Cycles** (via the Configure button or the Tile Card).
   - Find the recent "Unknown" cycle.
   - Open **Manage Profiles**, click **Create Profile**, name it (e.g., "Cotton 40"), and Save.
3. **Repeat**: Do this for your 2-3 most common programs.

### 3. Profile Granularity - How Detailed Should Profiles Be?

WashData matches cycles using **power-consumption shape, cycle duration, and total energy** - not temperature or spin-speed settings directly. This affects how granular your profile library should be.

#### What will be reliably auto-detected

Programs with clearly different durations or power patterns are always distinguished well:

| Example pair | Why it works |
| :--- | :--- |
| Quick Wash (~20 min) vs Cotton (~3 h) | Huge duration gap - no ambiguity |
| Wash-only vs Wash+Dry | Drying adds 100–200 min and significant extra energy |
| Cotton vs Delicates | Different agitation/heating patterns and often different durations |

#### Temperature and spin-speed variants

Programs that differ **only** in temperature or spin speed (e.g. Cotton 40°C vs Cotton 60°C) often produce similar power shapes and durations. The matcher will attempt to distinguish them using correlation and energy differences, but:

- On first run the system may assign the wrong variant - **use the Learning Feedbacks menu to correct it**.
- With a few confirmed corrections the system learns; 3–5 corrections per variant pair is usually enough.
- If your machine's power draw barely changes between temperatures, the variants may remain hard to distinguish automatically. In that case, selecting the program manually via the Program Selector dropdown remains reliable.

#### Practical advice for washer-dryer combos

Create **separate profiles** for every wash+dry combination you use regularly (e.g. "Cotton 40°C Wash", "Cotton 40°C + Cupboard Dry"). The drying phase adds so much duration and energy that wash-only vs wash+dry is one of the easiest distinctions for the matcher to make.

Start with a small set of your most-used and most-different programs, then add temperature/spin variants gradually as you accumulate history.

### 4. Verification & Learning
Once profiles are created, WashData starts **matching** new cycles automatically.
- **Feedback**: If a match is found but confidence is moderate, you may get a "Verify Cycle" notification.
- **Refinement**: Go to **Configure > Learning Feedbacks** to Confirm or Correct the detection.
- **Self-Improving**: Confirming a cycle helps the system refine its duration models.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting & Tuning

If "Auto-Detect" isn't working perfectly, use **Advanced Settings** to tune the logic for your specific machine.

> 📊 **[Click here for a Visual Guide to these settings](SETTINGS_VISUALIZED.md)** - Graphs explaining what the numbers actually do.

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cycle Starts Too Early** | Smart plug reports brief power spikes during boot/standby. | **Increase `Start Energy Threshold`** (e.g., to `2 Wh`). This forces the machine to consume actual energy before stating "Running". |
| **Cycle Ends Too Early** | Machine pauses (soaking) or has long low-power intervals. | **Increase `Off Delay`**. Give it more time (e.g. 5 mins) to wait before deciding the cycle is truly finished. |
| **False "Ghost" Cycles** | High-power usage at the very end (e.g. anti-crease or pump-out) triggers a new start. | **Increase `Minimum Off Gap`** (e.g. to `120s`). Forces a mandatory cooldown period between cycles. |
| **"Unknown" Matches** | Your profiles are too strict or variance is high. | **Increase `Duration Tolerance`** (e.g. `0.25`). Allows ±25% duration difference when matching. |
| **Notifications Too Late** | You want to know *before* it finishes. | **Set `Notify Before End Minutes`** (e.g. `5`). Get an alert 5 minutes before the estimated finish time. |
| **Persistent 'Running' State** | Integration stays locked to a long profile after a short cycle diverged. | **Adjust Matching Stability Thresholds** in `const.py`. Divergence detection now automatically reverts to "Detecting..." if confidence drops below 60% of the peak score. |

> **Pro Tip**: Use the **Apply Suggestions** button in Settings. It analyzes your history and calculates the perfect text-book values for your specific machine.

### Suggested Settings Sensor: What To Do

WashData exposes a diagnostic sensor: `sensor.<name>_suggested_settings`.

- `0` means there are currently no actionable recommendations.
- `> 0` means recommendations are ready to review.

When this sensor is above 0:
1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > WashData > Configure > Advanced Settings**.
2. Enable **Apply Suggested Values**.
3. Review the change summary step.
4. Confirm to stage values, then save only the changes you agree with.

Suggested values are optional and are never forced automatically.

### 🏷️ Phase Catalog & Assignment

Phases are descriptive labels for distinct power stages within a cycle (e.g., "Pre-Wash", "Heating", "Spin").

- **Manage Phase Catalog**: Go to **Configure > Manage Phase Catalog** to add, edit, or remove phase labels for each device type.
- **Assign Phases to a Profile**: In **Manage Profiles**, select **Assign Phase Ranges** and use the phase range editor to map time regions to phase labels.
- Phases are scoped to your device type - only relevant phases appear in the assignment dialog.

### Events

WashData fires the following events on the Home Assistant event bus, suitable as automation triggers (e.g. `platform: event`, `event_type: ha_washdata_cycle_ended`). All three events are gated by the **Fire Events** toggle in the Notifications options page (default: on); disable it to suppress them globally without touching automations.

#### `ha_washdata_cycle_started`
Fired immediately when a cycle is detected (i.e. when the state machine first leaves `OFF`). The profile match has typically not run yet, so `program` is usually `"detecting..."` or `"unknown"` at this point; use `ha_washdata_cycle_ended` if you need the resolved profile name.

```yaml
event_type: ha_washdata_cycle_started
data:
  entry_id: 01KR1WGJYHJBTT5MEGS0VRXC4D     # config-entry id, stable across restarts
  device_name: Waschmaschine                # the integration title you configured
  device_type: washing_machine              # washing_machine | dryer | dishwasher | oven | bread_maker | pump | ...
  program: "detecting..."                   # may resolve to a profile name later in the cycle
  start_time: "2026-05-09T07:43:08.626640+02:00"
```

#### `ha_washdata_cycle_ended`
Fired once the cycle has fully terminated and been written to history. Carries the full cycle record minus the raw power trace (`power_data`, `debug_data`, `power_trace` are stripped to stay under Home Assistant's 32 KB event payload limit; fetch them via the diagnostics download if you need the samples).

```yaml
event_type: ha_washdata_cycle_ended
data:
  entry_id: 01KR1WGJYHJBTT5MEGS0VRXC4D
  device_name: WashingMachine
  program: "40°C / 1200rpm / cotton"                    # resolved profile name, or "unknown" if no match

    max_power: 2063                         # watts (peak observed in the cycle)
    energy_wh: 1564.04                      # integrated energy over the cycle
    status: completed                       # completed | aborted | timeout
    termination_reason: timeout             # off_delay | smart_termination | timeout | force_end | zombie | ghost_suppressed
    profile_name: null                      # null when no profile was matched
    sampling_interval: 43                   # mean seconds between power readings
    device_type: washing_machine

      p50: 91
      p75: 203
      p95: 2024.8
```

#### `ha_washdata_pump_stuck`
*(Pump device type only.)* Fired once when an active pump cycle exceeds the configured stuck-pump duration. Useful for sump-pit, condensate, or borehole-pump alarms.

```yaml
event_type: ha_washdata_pump_stuck
data:
  entry_id: 01KR1WGJYHJBTT5MEGS0VRXC4D
  device: Sumppumpe                         # the integration title (note: legacy key name)
  elapsed_seconds: 1830                     # how long the pump had been running
  threshold_seconds: 1800                   # the configured stuck-pump threshold
```
