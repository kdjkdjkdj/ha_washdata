"""Regression tests for #384 - Lovelace card not displayed.

The dashboard reported ``Custom element not found: ha-washdata-card``, meaning
the card module never reached its ``customElements.define()``.  The card's
static path (which actually serves ``ha-washdata-card.js``) was registered as a
detached fire-and-forget task whose failures were swallowed at DEBUG, while the
Lovelace *resource* - the thing that makes every browser fetch that URL - was
registered right after.  So the browser could fetch the URL before the route
existed (404, module never runs), and a genuine registration failure left the
resource pointing at a permanently-404ing URL with no warning.

These tests lock in that the static path is registered *before* the Lovelace
resource, and that a genuine failure is reported as CARD_FAILED rather than
being silently reported as success.
