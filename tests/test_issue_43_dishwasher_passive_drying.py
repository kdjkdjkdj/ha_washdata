"""Regression tests for GitHub issue #43.

Dishwasher ECO cycles have a 2+ hour passive drying phase at near-0W power.
A terminal drain spike that fires shortly after the ENDING state is entered
resets _time_below_threshold.  The subsequent 60-min silence timeout then fires
at ~180 min — well before the real cycle end (~233 min for ECO) — and
_finish_cycle(keep_tail=False) snaps end_time back to _last_active_time (the
terminal drain spike at 120 min), storing only 120 min instead of 233 min and
corrupting the profile avg_duration.

Fixes:
  1. _should_defer_finish() now defers dishwasher cycles that are below 85%
     of the profile's expected duration, bypassing the confidence gate that
     was too strict during the passive drying phase.
  2. Fallback timeout calls _finish_cycle(keep_tail=True) for dishwashers so
     that, if deferral eventually expires, the stored end_time is the actual
     timeout timestamp rather than the terminal-spike _last_active_time.

      18:08:35  STARTING → RUNNING (active wash, ~85W, then 2000W heating)
      19:57:34  power drops to 0W → RUNNING → PAUSED
      19:57:44  PAUSED → ENDING                  (~109 min, 47% of expected)
      20:06:35  high-power spikes in ENDING       (~117 min, 50% of expected)
      ...       passive drying at 0–0.5W          (~117 min → 234 min)
      22:02:34  pump-out spike (16–20W, ~1 min)   (~234 min, 99% of expected)
      22:03:34  pump-out finishes, power drops to 0
      22:05:00  cycle should fully terminate

    The pre-fix bug:
      The mid-cycle spike at ~117 min (50% of expected) set _end_spike_seen=True,
      which pre-armed Smart Termination so it fired at 99% of expected (~222 min)
      and closed the cycle BEFORE the real pump-out arrived.  The pump-out at
      ~234 min was then registered as a brand-new cycle.

    The fix gates _end_spike_seen=True on duration >= 85% of expected, so the
    mid-cycle spike is ignored, Smart Termination waits for the real end spike
    (the pump-out), and the pump-out is folded into the original cycle.
