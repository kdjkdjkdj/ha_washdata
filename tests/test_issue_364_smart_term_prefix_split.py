"""Issue #364: a running wash must not be finalized at a shorter profile's length.

Reported on a Miele washer: a ~119 min programme was closed with
termination_reason "smart" at 4638 s because the live matcher had locked onto the
shorter "Oberhemden 40" profile (4731 s), and 4638/4731 = 0.980 is exactly the
ratio both Smart-Termination paths fire at. Power at that moment was still
100-165 W, far above the 5 W stop threshold. The remaining rinse/spin was then
recorded as a second cycle.

Root cause: both paths key on `elapsed >= 0.98 * expected` and neither asked
whether the appliance was still working. The #288 prefix-landscape guard could
not help - in one reported case the programme actually running had never been
trained, so no longer candidate existed to notice.

The fix compares the trailing mean power against what the matched profile itself
draws at its own end (`profile_store.profile_tail_power`, pushed to the detector
as element 9 of the match tuple). Shorten-only: it can only block an early
finish, never end a cycle sooner, and with no tail power it is inert.
