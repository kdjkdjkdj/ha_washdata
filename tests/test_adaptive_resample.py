    # clamped to max_dt=30? No, wait.
    # If source is 60s, and we resample to 30s, we are interpolating fake data.
    # The instruction says: "never resample finer than the sensor’s typical cadence"
    # So if median is 60, and max_dt is 30... we should probably use 60?
    # Or should we respect max_dt as a limit for *matching resolution*?
    # User said: "resample for matching using dt = clamp(median_dt, min_dt, max_dt)"
    # AND "never resample finer than the sensor’s typical cadence"
    # So effective_dt = max(median_dt, min_dt) roughly?
    # Actually: clamp(median_dt, min_dt, max_dt) implies if median is 60, we force 30.
    # But user also said "never resample finer...".
    # Interpretation: 
    # IF median_dt < min_dt (e.g. 1s data): downsample to min_dt (5s). OK.
    # IF median_dt > max_dt (e.g. 120s data): 
    #   User said "never resample finer than sensor's typical cadence".
    #   So if sensor is 120s, we should use 120s?
    #   But "clamp(median, min, max)" would force it down to max?
    #   Let's re-read carefully: "dt = clamp(median_dt, min_dt, max_dt) ... and never resample finer than the sensor’s typical cadence."
    #   If median is 120s. clamp(120, 5, 30) -> 30s.
    #   Resampling 120s data to 30s IS interpolating (finer).
    #   So "never resample finer" conflicts with "clamp max".
    #   Unless max_dt is meant to be logic for "if it's enormous, treat as events", but for DTW we need a grid.
    #   Maybe the user meant: dt = max(median_dt, min_dt). And maybe there is no max_dt for *sampling*, only for *features*?
    #   Or maybe "max_dt" is for "don't match using 5 min intervals"?
    #   Let's assume:
    #   If median > max_dt: use median (don't upsample).
    #   If median < min_dt: use min_dt (downsample).
    #   If min < median < max: use median.
    
    #   So dt = max(median_dt, min_dt)
