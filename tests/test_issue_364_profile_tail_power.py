"""Issue #364: ProfileStore.profile_tail_power, the reference level for the
Smart-Termination power-plausibility guard.

The guard asks "are we drawing far more than this profile draws at its own end?".
That reference comes from the profile's envelope when it has one, and from its
sample cycle when it does not - the fallback is load-bearing, not a nicety: on the
reporting user's store only 7 of 13 profiles have an envelope, and the profile
family named in the report is one of the envelope-less ones. Without the fallback
a thinly-trained profile would silently get no guard at all.

Pure statistics, never raises: anything unusable returns None, which the detector
reads as "no opinion" and leaves both Smart-Termination paths untouched.
