"""Register item 351: the two writers of ``detector.config`` must agree.

``CycleDetectorConfig`` is populated twice - once in the manager's constructor and
once, field by field, in ``async_reload_config`` - and nothing checked that the two
lists match. They did not:

* ``min_off_gap`` was only in the constructor, so changing Min Off Gap in the panel
  did nothing until Home Assistant restarted. It is half of
  ``effective_off_delay = max(off_delay, min_off_gap)``, i.e. the wait that ends
  every cycle, and 0.5.7 had just made it a visible setting. Found by
  ``devtools/testbox/check_unload_confirm.sh``, which wrote ``min_off_gap=10`` and
  then watched a washing machine sit in ENDING for its 480 s default.
* ``profile_duration_tolerance`` was only in the reload path, the same bug pointing
  the other way: after a restart the detector used 0.25 regardless of the setting,
  until the user happened to save something.

So this file does not test either key. It tests the *lists*, because the failure
mode is a key being forgotten: reload a manager onto a second set of options and
require the result to equal what constructing it with those options directly
produces. Any field either writer forgets fails here.
