"""Threshold sweep for the Smart-Termination split guards (issue #364).

``dtw_ab_eval.py`` answers "did matching accuracy regress?" - it only ever scores
COMPLETE cycles, so it cannot say whether these guards discriminate. This harness
answers that, by rebuilding the two populations that matter:

  POSITIVE ("would split")   a long cycle's trace TRUNCATED to the point where a
                             SHORTER profile is winning the match. This is the
                             #364 failure: Smart Termination fires at 0.98x that
                             shorter profile's duration and the remainder becomes
                             a second cycle. The guard SHOULD fire here.
  NEGATIVE ("genuine end")   a cycle at its own true end, matched to its own
                             profile. The guard MUST NOT fire: every false fire
                             is a legitimate cycle pushed onto the slower
                             power-based fallback timeout.

Two independent guards are swept:

  prefix     _match_prefix_ambiguity's prefix term - does a LONGER candidate's
             curve, truncated to the elapsed duration, explain the trace better
             than the winner does, by SMART_TERM_PREFIX_MARGIN?
  power      is the trailing mean power more than SMART_TERM_TAIL_MAX_RATIO x what
             the matched profile draws at its own end?

Both are shorten-only: firing can only ever BLOCK an early finish, never end a
cycle sooner. That asymmetry is why the false-block column is a cost (a later
finish) and the missed column is the bug (a split cycle), and why the operating
point sits well clear of the false-block knee.

Run from the repo root:  python3 devtools/prefix_guard_eval.py
cycle_data/ is gitignored, so this is maintainer-local.
